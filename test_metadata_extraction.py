"Network Provider" means hospitals or health care providers enlisted by an insurer, TPA or jointly by an Insurer and TPA to provide medical services to an insured by a cashless facility.

COVERAGE AND BENEFITS
This comprehensive insurance policy provides extensive coverage for medical expenses incurred during hospitalization and treatment. The policy covers a wide range of medical conditions and procedures, subject to the terms and conditions outlined in this document. Room rent is covered up to 1% of the sum insured per day for general ward accommodation, with a maximum limit as specified in the policy schedule.

Voluntary medical termination of pregnancy during the first 12 weeks is not covered.

WAITING PERIODS
Maternity benefits have a waiting period of 24 months from policy inception date.

For emergency hospitalization, intimation must be given within 24 hours of admission. Original bills, receipts, discharge summary, investigation reports, and other relevant documents must be submitted for claim processing. The insurer reserves the right to call for additional documents if required for claim assessment. Claims are typically processed within 15 working days of receipt of all required documents. In case of cashless treatment at network hospitals, the insured must present the health card and valid photo ID at the time of admission. The hospital will coordinate with the insurer or TPA for approval of cashless treatment. Any non-medical expenses or items not covered under the policy will need to be paid directly by the insured."""
