      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?",
          "answer": "In his Principia, Newton demonstrates this by first inferring from Kepler's second law (proportionality of areas to times) that the force retaining a planet in its orbit is directed towards the sun. From Kepler's first law (that planets move in ellipses with the sun in one focus), he inferred that this force varies inversely as the square of the distance. He then verified this by comparing the force needed to keep the moon in its orbit with the force of gravity at the Earth's surface, finding them to be consistent with an inverse-square law."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?",
          "answer": "Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure of motion arising from the velocity and quantity of matter jointly. It is distinct from 'force' in that 'quantity of motion' is a property of a moving body, while an 'impressed force' is an action exerted upon a body to change its state of either rest or uniform motion. Newton clarifies that this force consists only in the action and does not remain in the body after the action is over."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?",
          "answer": "Newton addresses motion in resisting media by proposing different models of resistance. He analyzes motion where resistance is directly proportional to velocity and where it is proportional to the square of the velocity. In the Principia's second book, he provides mathematical propositions for determining the motion of bodies under these conditions, including the motion of projectiles and the oscillations of pendulums, and compares his theoretical findings with experimental results."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?",
          "answer": "Newton explains that all planets mutually gravitate towards one another. The force of gravity from one planet can therefore disturb the orbit of another. He notes that the mutual actions are very small and can often be neglected, but in cases like the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn, their mutual attractions \"sensibly disturb each other's motions\". He calculates that these perturbations can cause a planet's eccentricity to change, its aphelion to move forward or backward, and its mean motion to accelerate or retard."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?",
          "answer": "Newton defines centripetal force as the force by which bodies are drawn, impelled, or in any way tend towards a point as to a centre. He explains that without this force, a body in motion (like a planet or a stone in a sling) would travel in a straight line. Orbital motion is therefore the result of a \"contrary force which restrains\" the body, perpetually drawing it aside from its rectilinear path and compelling it to revolve in a curvilinear orbit around the centre of force."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?",
          "answer": "According to the provided text, the descent of Sir Isaac Newton cannot be traced with certainty beyond his grandfather, Robert Newton. The text mentions two family traditions: one that they were of Scotch extraction, and another that they came from Newton in Lancashire."
        },
        {
          "question": "According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?",
          "answer": "Newton's three laws of motion are: Law I: Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon. In celestial mechanics, this explains why planets and comets maintain their forward motion. Law II: The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed. This law is used to determine the effects of gravitational forces on the orbits of celestial bodies. Law III: To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts. This applies to the mutual gravitational attraction between celestial bodies, such as the sun and a planet, or a planet and its moon."
        },
        {
          "question": "Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?",
          "answer": "The grandfather of Sir Isaac Newton was Robert Newton."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?",
          "answer": "Newton argues for universal gravitation based on Rule III of his \"Rules of Reasoning in Philosophy,\" which states that qualities found in all bodies within reach of experiments are to be esteemed as universal qualities of all bodies. Since it appears from experiments and astronomical observations that all bodies on Earth, the moon, and all planets gravitate towards each other in proportion to their quantity of matter, he concludes that all bodies whatsoever must be endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?",
          "answer": "Newton demonstrates that if a body is acted upon by a force directed towards an immovable centre, it will describe areas proportional to the times. He proves this by imagining time divided into equal parts; in the first part, the body moves in a straight line by its inertia (Law I). In the next instant, a centripetal force acts with a single impulse, turning the body into a new path, and he shows through geometry that the triangular area swept out is equal to the area that would have been swept out without the impulse. By diminishing these intervals of time into infinity, the series of impulses becomes a continuous force, and the resulting orbit sweeps out areas proportional to the times."
        },
        {
          "question": "What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?",
          "answer": "In the Principia, Newton utilized a geometric form of calculus, which he referred to as the \"method of first and last ratios of quantities\". This method involves finding the ultimate ratios of \"nascent and evanescent quantities\" (quantities as they are just beginning or vanishing), which is conceptually equivalent to finding limits and derivatives. Although he had already invented the method of fluxions (his notation for calculus), he chose a geometrical approach for the Principia because he censured handling geometrical subjects with algebraic calculations and was a great admirer of the \"taste and form of demonstration\" of the ancient geometers."
        },
        {
          "question": "In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?",
          "answer": "Newton explains that absolute space and time form a fixed, unmoving background, which supports his laws because a true change in motion can only be caused by an impressed force, whereas relative motion between objects can change without any force at all being applied to the body in question."

          "question": "How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?",
          "answer": "In his Principia, Newton demonstrates this by first inferring from Kepler's second law (proportionality of areas to times) that the force retaining a planet in its orbit is directed towards the sun. From Kepler's first law (that planets move in ellipses with the sun in one focus), he inferred that this force varies inversely as the square of the distance. He then verified this by comparing the force needed to keep the moon in its orbit with the force of gravity at the Earth's surface, finding them to be consistent with an inverse-square law."

        {
          "question": "How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?",
          "answer": "Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure of motion arising from the velocity and quantity of matter jointly. It is distinct from 'force' in that 'quantity of motion' is a property of a moving body, while an 'impressed force' is an action exerted upon a body to change its state of either rest or uniform motion. Newton clarifies that this force consists only in the action and does not remain in the body after the action is over."

        {
          "question": "How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?",
          "answer": "Newton addresses motion in resisting media by proposing different models of resistance. He analyzes motion where resistance is directly proportional to velocity and where it is proportional to the square of the velocity. In the Principia's second book, he provides mathematical propositions for determining the motion of bodies under these conditions, including the motion of projectiles and the oscillations of pendulums, and compares his theoretical findings with experimental results."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?",
          "answer": "Newton explains that all planets mutually gravitate towards one another. The force of gravity from one planet can therefore disturb the orbit of another. He notes that the mutual actions are very small and can often be neglected, but in cases like the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn, their mutual attractions \"sensibly disturb each other's motions\". He calculates that these perturbations can cause a planet's eccentricity to change, its aphelion to move forward or backward, and its mean motion to accelerate or retard."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?",
          "answer": "Newton defines centripetal force as the force by which bodies are drawn, impelled, or in any way tend towards a point as to a centre. He explains that without this force, a body in motion (like a planet or a stone in a sling) would travel in a straight line. Orbital motion is therefore the result of a \"contrary force which restrains\" the body, perpetually drawing it aside from its rectilinear path and compelling it to revolve in a curvilinear orbit around the centre of force."

        {
          "question": "According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?",
          "answer": "Newton's three laws of motion are: Law I: Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon. In celestial mechanics, this explains why planets and comets maintain their forward motion. Law II: The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed. This law is used to determine the effects of gravitational forces on the orbits of celestial bodies. Law III: To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts. This applies to the mutual gravitational attraction between celestial bodies, such as the sun and a planet, or a planet and its moon."

        {
          "question": "What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?",
          "answer": "Newton argues for universal gravitation based on Rule III of his \"Rules of Reasoning in Philosophy,\" which states that qualities found in all bodies within reach of experiments are to be esteemed as universal qualities of all bodies. Since it appears from experiments and astronomical observations that all bodies on Earth, the moon, and all planets gravitate towards each other in proportion to their quantity of matter, he concludes that all bodies whatsoever must be endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?",
          "answer": "Newton demonstrates that if a body is acted upon by a force directed towards an immovable centre, it will describe areas proportional to the times. He proves this by imagining time divided into equal parts; in the first part, the body moves in a straight line by its inertia (Law I). In the next instant, a centripetal force acts with a single impulse, turning the body into a new path, and he shows through geometry that the triangular area swept out is equal to the area that would have been swept out without the impulse. By diminishing these intervals of time into infinity, the series of impulses becomes a continuous force, and the resulting orbit sweeps out areas proportional to the times."

        {
          "question": "What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?",
          "answer": "In the Principia, Newton utilized a geometric form of calculus, which he referred to as the \"method of first and last ratios of quantities\". This method involves finding the ultimate ratios of \"nascent and evanescent quantities\" (quantities as they are just beginning or vanishing), which is conceptually equivalent to finding limits and derivatives. Although he had already invented the method of fluxions (his notation for calculus), he chose a geometrical approach for the Principia because he censured handling geometrical subjects with algebraic calculations and was a great admirer of the \"taste and form of demonstration\" of the ancient geometers."

        {
          "question": "In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?",
          "answer": "Newton explains that absolute space and time form a fixed, unmoving background, which supports his laws because a true change in motion can only be caused by an impressed force, whereas relative motion between objects can change without any force at all being applied to the body in question."

        {
          "question": "If a religious place stops me from entering because I'm a woman, is that constitutional?",
          "answer": "This is a complex issue. While Article 15 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in accessing places of public resort, Article 26 allows religious denominations to manage their own affairs in matters of religion. However, courts have interpreted these rights to ensure that fundamental rights are upheld, and gender-based discrimination for entry into public temples has been held unconstitutional."
